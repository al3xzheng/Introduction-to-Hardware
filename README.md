My Learnings...

Please check out the document above to learn more about my documentation on my electronics / electrical engineering journey.
This document provides My Learnings on Electrical Engineering from January 2025 - August 2025.

It includes power & signal integrity, filters, control systems, some signal processing, microelectronics, communication protocols, motors, and general principles on passive and active components.

This ReadMe is super underwhelming to the scale that is the 39000 word document, 144 pages of concise text and graphics... Check it out! You'll definitely learn something, and maybe something that
which you were looking for!

Please check out the headings tab to browse through.

Additionally, I have attached very interesting literature on electronics.
