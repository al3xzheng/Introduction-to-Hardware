My Learnings...

Please check out the document above to learn more about my documentation on my electronics / electrical engineering journey.
This document provides My Learnings on Electrical Engineering from January 2025 - August 2025.

It includes power & signal integrity, filters, control systems, some signal processing, microelectronics, communication protocols, motors, and general principles on passive and active components.

Please check out the headings tab to browse through.

Additionally, I have attached very interesting literature on electronics.
