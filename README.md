# **My Learnings...**

## Please check out the document above "_My Learnings_" and resources in "_Literature_" to learn more about my documentation on my electronics / electrical engineering journey.

The document provides My Learnings on Electrical Engineering from January 2025 - August 2025. It includes power & signal integrity, semiconductors, microelectronics,  PCB design & layout + stack up, filters, power systems, motors, control systems, some signal processing, microelectronics, communication protocols, motors, and general principles on passive and active components.

This ReadMe is super underwhelming to the scale that is the 39000+ words, 144 pages, all of concise text and graphics, plus carefully chosen resources in electronics that is in Literature. 

**Check it out!** 

_You'll definitely learn something, and maybe something that which you were looking for!_
